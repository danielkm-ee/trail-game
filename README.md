# trail-game

Written in Javascript using the p5.js framework, this is a trail environment for the Santa Fe Trail, John Muir Trail, and arbitrary trail tasks.

Controls: 
- If using LRM (left, right, move) you may turn the ant left with `j`, or right with `k`, and move the ant forward using `f`
- If using UDLR (up, down, left, right) you may move the ant using the arrow keys on your keyboard

To launch the emulator simply launch the 'index.html' file.
